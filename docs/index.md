## Statement

The path to success, action, and productivity is not reflected in a job vita you can read on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-schneutzer-50169817/"Linkedin"). It's the things you won't find there. Here's a short bio with interesting insight for the Redbull Basement Program. 

Today  I  feel home in Hamburg (Germany) and Goa (India). I work with topics I really love, like AI, Microsoft Technology, Business Development, Entrepreneurship in an international environment - and it happened with being employed at NTT Germany and them allowing me to do so.

## Objective

* Always do what I believe in. 
* Today is always the perfect day to start something new. 
* Be the trusted person I want to rely on.
* Whenever I am scared to do something, ensure that I am doing it.
